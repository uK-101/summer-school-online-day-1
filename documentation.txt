3. How your navigation structure works?
 → In the portfolio.html, the nav tag links it to contact.html and about.html
   In the about.html, I added an internal link to access portfolio.html and I used an external link to my own linkedin profile
   In the contact.html, I added link to portfolio.html and about.html
   Thus, we can access any of the file from any of the web page easily.
